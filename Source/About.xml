In this mod two unusual trees were added which could be grown only in special pot. 
I recomend use this mod with SeedsPlease mod, but it worked without too.

Support me on patreon, it will motivate me to continue: https://www.patreon.com/cattleya . I public here some sketches, ideas, thoughts and anounces. Also be free to write me, maybe will draw some things for you for Rimworld!
